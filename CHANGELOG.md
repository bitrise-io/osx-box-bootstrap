## `2016_06_18_1`

* `android-24` is no longer preview - package names were changed


## `2016_06_15_3`

* `xcode-version-map-files-playbook` / `DEPRECATED-create-xcode-version-mapping` removed. This was deprecated
  for a long time now, and it had no purpose on the new Stacks / recommended environments, where only one Xcode
  is available, at it's canonical location (in `/Applications/`)


## `2016_06_15_2`

* `ruby` : switched back from our pinned Ruby 2.2.4 to the latest `brew` installed ruby version.
  CocoaPods 1.x should properly work with the new `ruby` version now.


## `2016_06_15_1`

* `wine` removed. We really wanted to keep it around, but so far we had more issues with `wine` than we had with any other tool..
  We decided to remove it for now as it breaks the install/provision process - if the new Xcode 8 (beta) is installed on the system
  `wine` fails to install.


## `2016_06_11_1`

* `bitrise` (CLI): `1.3.5`


## `2016_05_14_1`

* `bitrise` (CLI): `1.3.4`


## `2016_04_27_1`

* `bitrise` (CLI) : `1.3.3`


## `2016_04_26_1`

* Bit of reorganization: after `bitrise run provision-vm` you now have to run `bitrise run perform-weekly-cache-update`,
  to not to duplicate tasks/scripts between the initial setup and the weekly cache updates.
* `bitrise` (CLI) : `1.3.2`
* `bitrise-bridge` : `0.9.8`
* Cleanup: make sure that `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` is empty before saving the virtual machine image

## `2016_02_24_1`

* `wine` temporarily removed from this version. There's an ongoing issue with
  one of its dependency which downloads from http://www.freedesktop.org/ - the
  site is down for more than 5 hours now.
