## `v2017_05_02_1`

* Xamarin Only: .Net Core __removed__, no longer preinstalled. Please use the new `install-dotnetcore` step instead.
    * Thanks @stefandevo for the changes!
    * TL;DR; installation of .Net Core right now is still a bit "beta", we'll consider pre-installing .Net Core
      in the future again once it lands in `brew`. Until that it's way more flexible to use a Step
      instead, which can be updated any time, instead of sticking to a preinstalled version
      which is hard & slow to change.

  is available, at it's canonical location (in `/Applications/`)

  CocoaPods 1.x should properly work with the new `ruby` version now.


## `2016_06_15_1`

* `wine` removed. We really wanted to keep it around, but so far we had more issues with `wine` than we had with any other tool..
  We decided to remove it for now as it breaks the install/provision process - if the new Xcode 8 (beta) is installed on the system
  `wine` fails to install.

  to not to duplicate tasks/scripts between the initial setup and the weekly cache updates.
* `bitrise` (CLI) : `1.3.2`
* `bitrise-bridge` : `0.9.8`
